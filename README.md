## Design: 
- We used Scanner to process user inputs.
- ID numbers begin with 1.
- An ArrayList of services in order of most to least priority is created.
1. The services are printed, and users are asked to input the number corresponding to the service (1 = first service) and its priority.
2. The user is asked to input his/her name.
3. A Ticket is created with the ID number, description of service that corresponds to the number inputted, inputted number that represents its priority, and the user's name.
4. That Ticket is added to the HelpDesk's data, maintaining order of priority (left to right = least to most priority). 
5. The user is asked if he/she has any more problems. If the user inputs 0, the ID number is incremented by 1 and the process is repeated. If the user inputs 1, the prompting ends.
